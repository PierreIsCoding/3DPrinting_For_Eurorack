# Print your Eurorack stuff
This project contains STL files for printing usefull parts for your (Eurorack) Modular.


## Rails
The Rails file will give you a 3d printable rails for your Eurorack case. Instead of expensive Eurorack sliding nust and bolts this works with regular M3 fasteners!

# Panels
The 4HP and 8HP Panels are designed for general purpose usage. In the back of the panel a grid is implemented so you can easily drill holes for pots and jacks in a orderly fashion. Also check out the pcb mounting parts. These need to be glued together with the panel. A pcb can be screwed in with M2 wood screws. See example below
